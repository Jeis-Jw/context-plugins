# Bobbin

Keep the thread.

[한국어](README.ko.md)

## What is it?

Bobbin keeps durable project context across AI coding sessions: decisions and their
reasons, verified observations, unfinished work, assumptions, terminology, intent
and living documents. Records are local Markdown files in `context/`; Git is
optional. No hosted service, database or API key is required.

## Why use it?

Keep the reasoning behind a choice, recall it when it matters, and continue work
without repeating the whole conversation. One plugin contains all features; each
project chooses which semantic features participate.

## Install

Bobbin 1.0.0 requires Python 3.11+ and Codex or Claude Code. The source repository
is [Jeis-Jw/bobbin](https://github.com/Jeis-Jw/bobbin).

```bash
# Codex
codex plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Jeis-Jw/bobbin.git
codex plugin add bobbin@bobbin

# Claude Code
claude plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Jeis-Jw/bobbin.git --scope user
claude plugin install bobbin@bobbin --scope user
```

Disable old `context-*` providers first; do not run both generations together.
Reload the host or start a new session after installation.
For local development, substitute the actual Bobbin checkout path for the Git URL.

## How to use it

Run `$bobbin:init` in your project and choose features and a recording mode.
Init configures the already-installed plugin; it does not install anything.

| Setting | Choices |
|---|---|
| Semantic features | Decision, Assumption, Term, Intent, Document |
| Always available | Observation, Snapshot, Archive |
| Recording mode | `explicit`, `auto`, `adaptive` |

Fresh setup defaults to Decision and `explicit`. Existing projects retain
explicit authorization and import their registered features. Re-running init
preserves omitted choices. Disabling a feature preserves its records and
explicit historical reads, but stops automatic participation and new writes.

- **explicit**: Your clear decision or request to remember is already approval.
  Bobbin asks only when the meaning, scope or lifecycle is unresolved.
- **auto**: Eligible durable context is recorded without per-record questions.
- **adaptive**: The LLM records directly or asks when confirmation matters,
  considering ambiguity, evidence, scope, existing conflicts and consequences.

Auto is not a transcript recorder. In every mode, a proposal remains a proposal;
the model cannot invent a user commitment or label its own preference as a DEC.
The recording mode does not authorize unrelated code changes or external actions.

Project settings live in `.bobbin/config.json`, separate from generated
`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` guidance and the record index. Projects may share a vault
while retaining independent feature and approval settings.

Use natural requests such as “Why did we choose this?”, “Keep this decision”,
or “Save where we stopped.” Bobbin uses relevant records without loading the
entire vault. Exact-payload validation and write integrity remain active in
every approval mode.
