description: Save, update, load, or discard a named SNAP handoff for unfinished work when the user explicitly asks; load it when a session resumes earlier work.

# Snapshot

SNAP is mutable resume context with `authority: staging`; it is not authoritative decision or evidence history. Do not read `references/`, plugin manifests, `context/*.index.md`, or plugin scripts, and never run `--help`; the commands below are complete. Use the active language for user text and English for machine fields; preserve user-authored artifact prose.

1. Resume: when the user asks to continue earlier work without restating it, run one `snapshot list`, then `snapshot load --id <id>` for the matching SNAP, and continue from its Next steps and Open items under its stated constraints. Do not ask the user to restate what the SNAP already says.
2. Save only with both unfinished context and explicit handoff intent. `save` is create-only and fills Current context, Open items, and Next steps; state the exact next step and any constraint the user gave.
3. `update` is full replacement unless deliberate `--merge`; `load.freshness` is only a warning. `discard` targets one SNAP. SNAP has no archive, history, or retired state.

A direct, explicit, unconditional handoff request that settles the snapshot content and scope is semantic approval. If meaning is unresolved, ask one concise semantic question; acknowledgement, praise, a condition, an edit request, or a topic change is not approval. Do not show the rendered file body or ask a second storage question. Then run one `save --approved` (or `update --approved`) in the same response: it runs the internal preview, freezes the receipt, and applies it unchanged; keep every transport detail private and never regenerate after approval. If rendering adds or changes meaning, it stops: hold the write and confirm only that semantic delta. The command output is the confirmation; do not re-read the file afterwards. `approval_digest` stays internal either way. Low-level orchestration: `save` without `--approved` writes nothing and returns a frozen receipt; pass `result.receipt_file` and `result.approval_digest` unchanged to `transaction apply --receipt-file ... --approved-digest ...`. Receipt self-digests are damage checks, not approval evidence, and no directory scan is allowed.

Resolve `/loaded/...` from this file's own path in the skill catalog. Open items and next steps take one item per line (a `- ` bullet is optional), each at most 240 characters; the context is one paragraph.

```bash
